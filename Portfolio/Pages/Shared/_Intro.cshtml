    Hello, my name is Scott Falbo, I'm a software developer and artist in Seattle. <br /><br />
    As a professional tattoo artist, and studio owner, my main focus has always been to drive an agile, creative work environment, by adapting to growing or changing industry trends.<br /><br />
    My career two decade career has centered around creating, and implementing, large scale custom projects based on customer driven input.<br /><br />
    I’m enthusiastic about the opportunity to work with new people, and learn new perspectives and modalities.<br /><br />
